# Gene analysis scripts collection

 This repository serves as a central hub for gene analysis scripts and tools created by  students in *"AI Foundation Certification Course"* . The genes are mainly associated with **MND** *(Motor Neuron Diseases)* also known as **ALS** *(Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis)*, a fatal disease that affects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.

 ## About This Collection

This collection brings together various computational approaches and scripts for analyzing the gene related to **MND** . Each linked repository represents unique work by different contributors, showcasing diverse approaches to gene analysis.
