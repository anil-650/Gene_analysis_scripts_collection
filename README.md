# Gene analysis scripts collection

 This repository serves as a central hub for gene analysis scripts and tools created by  students in *"AI Foundation Certification Course"* . The genes are mainly associated with **MND** *(Motor Neuron Diseases)* also known as **ALS** *(Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis)*, a fatal disease that affects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.

 ## About This Collection

This collection brings together various computational approaches and scripts for analyzing the gene related to **MND** . Each linked repository represents unique work by different contributors, showcasing diverse approaches to gene analysis.

### Projects:

- [Human TBK1 Gene Analysis][TBK1_repo] - Python scripts using `re` for basic sequence analysis and visualization of the TBK1 gene. (by Anil Kumar Hansda [@anil-650][anil-650])
- [Human KIF5A Gene Analysis][KIF5A_repo] - Python scripts for analysis and visualization of the KIF5A gene using `Biopython`. (by Monalisa Padhi [@Monalisa29-AI][Monalisa29-AI])

### How to Contribute

If you're a student in *Genomics* group with a project you'd like to add to this collection:

1. Fork this repository
1. Add your project information to the README
1. Submit a pull request with a brief description of your addition
